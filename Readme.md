The Building Coder Samples illustrate numerous aspects and example usages of the Revit API.

Please refer to [The Building Coder](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com) for further information.

Keywords: Revit API C# .NET add-in.

## Installation

You can install each individual command separately by creating an add-in manifest file for it,
e.g. [TheBuildingCoderSingleSample.addin](TheBuildingCoderSingleSample.addin) is
set up to load the external command CmdDemoCheck.

Simply copy both `BuildingCoder.dll` and `TheBuildingCoderSingleSample.addin` to
the [Revit Add-Ins folder](http://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2015/ENU/?guid=GUID-4FFDB03E-6936-417C-9772-8FC258A261F7).

To save implementing a separate add-in manifest entry for each individual command, you can also use the Revit SDK sample RvtSamples.

It is an external application that reads a list of external commands from a text file and creates a ribbon menu to launch them all.

[BcSamples.txt](BcSamples.txt) lists all The Building Coder sample commands in the required format to be used as
an [RvtSamples include file](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2008/11/loading-the-building-coder-samples.html).
